Assume that\nthe individual thermometer component lifetimes are normally distributed with ms and\nstandard deviations provided in Table 24.3.\nUsing the following random numbers, simulate the lifetime (time to failure) of the temperature\nrecording system and estimate its m and standard deviation. The lifetime to failure is\ndefined as the time (in weeks) for one of the thermometers to \u201cfail\u201d.\nMonte Carlo simulation is a procedure for mimicking observations on a random variable that\npermits verification of results that would ordinarily require difficult mathematical calculations or\nextensive experimentation. The method normally uses computer programs called random\nnumber generators. A random number is a number selected from the interval (0, 1) in such a\nway that the probabilities that the number comes from any two subintervals of equal length\nare equal. For example, the probability the number is in the sub-interval (0.1, 0.3) is the\nsame as the probability that the number is in the subinterval (0.5, 0.7). Thus, random numbers\nare observations on a random variable X having a uniform distribution on the interval (0, 1). This\nms that the pdf of X is specified by:\nf(x) = 1; 0 , x , 1\n     = 0; elsewhere\nThe above pdf assigns equal probability to subintervals of equal length in the interval (0, 1).\nUsing random number generators, Monte Carlo simulation can generate observed values of a\nrandom variable having any specified pdf. For example, to generate observed values of T, the\ntime to failure, when T is assumed to have a pdf specified by f (t), first use the random\nnumber generator to generate a value of X between 0 and 1. The solution is an observed\nvalue of the random variable T having pdf specified by f (t).
